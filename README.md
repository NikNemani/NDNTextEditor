# NDNTextEditor
I created a rudimentary text editor using C++ and the Ncurses Library in Linux. It provides a simple command-line interface for text editing. The Text Editor also uses Object Oriented concepts that gives it the capability to switch between multiple files.

**Fun Fact**: NDN are my intials, which is why I called it NDNTextEditor
